                <h3>Learn About computer science</h3>
                <p>Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information.
                    Computer science spans theoretical disciplines, such as algorithms,
                    theory of computation, and information theory, to practical disciplines
                    including the design and implementation of hardware and software.
                    Computer science is generally considered an area of academic 
                    research and distinct from computer programming.</p>

                <h3>Learn About General science</h3>
                <p>The House of General Science was originally started by members of the Alpha Chi Sigma (ΑΧΣ)
                    Chemistry Fraternity in Gibson Hall. 
                    However, they realized that devoting a single floor to chemistry was too narrow,
                    and could easily attract more members by branching into all sciences.</p>

                <h3>Learn About Crop science</h3>
                <p>Crop Science is the originator of two spin-off journals, 
                   The Plant Genome and the Journal of Plant Registrations. The former was published as a supplement to Crop
                   Science from 2006-2008, and launched as a separate open access journal later that year.
                   The Journal of Plant Registrations was established as a separate journal in 2007,
                   featuring an expanded format for crop registrations describing newly developed plant varieties, parental lines, germplasms, genetic stocks, and populations.</p>

                <h3>Learn About fishery science</h3>
                <p>Fisheries science is the academic discipline of managing and understanding fisheries.It is a multidisciplinary science, which draws on the disciplines of limnology,
                     oceanography, freshwater biology, marine biology, meteorology, conservation, ecology, population dynamics, economics, statistics, decision analysis, management,
                     and many others in an attempt to provide an integrated picture of fisheries.
                     In some cases new disciplines have emerged,
                     as in the case of bioeconomics and fisheries law.</p>
